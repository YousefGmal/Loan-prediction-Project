# Loan-prediction-Project
In this project, the most important question was what are the 
criteria for accepting a loan
I made an EDA and replaced the missing values from each 
column with appropriate and closer to the correct values by 
exploring the relationships of the columns with each other to 
improve the expected results
I converted the columns that contain descriptive values to 
columns that contain numeric values to prepare the data and 
train the machine learning model on this data
The purpose of the model is to determine whether this person will 
be approved for a loan or not
I used pandas, seaborn, skit-learn libraries
